# r_presentation_to_python_users
Slides for a presentation I gave on 2018-08-17. Currently hosted at https://mdneuzerling.com/Rmd/user2018_full.html.

This presentation was originally meant to be a summary of the [UseR2018 conference](https://user2018.r-project.org/), but it became more about spruiking the wonders of R. Please reach out if you have any questions.

Many thanks to the Twitter users who helped me with ideas:
