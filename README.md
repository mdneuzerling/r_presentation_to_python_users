# r_presentation_to_python_users
Slides for a presentation I gave to some Python-using data scientists on 2018-08-17

This presentation was originally meant to be a summary of the [UseR2018 conference](https://user2018.r-project.org/), but it became more about spruiking the wonders of R. My presentation style makes the slides useless by themselves, but please reach out if you have any questions.

Many thanks to the Twitter users who helped me with ideas:
